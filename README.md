## Projects % internship
Here are some of my notable projects:

- Malware creation (DLL injection using a trojan):
    - Created a convincing user interface and installation process with Inno Setup, embedding malicious scripts and binaries alongside legitimate Notepad++ files.
    - Integrated the trojan code written in C++ within the installer, programmed to execute upon installation completion to inject malicious payloads into explorer.exe.
    - Employed WinReg techniques, such as Juicy Potato, to exploit registry settings and impersonate privileged accounts, bypassing security measures and gaining elevated system access.
      
- Development of end-to-end incident response:
    - Tested multiple attack vectors and simulated realistic incident scenarios using tools like Metasploit and Nmap. Designed incident architecture to effectively contain and eradicate threats.
    - Traced Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and analyzed general Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).


- Project management web application:
    - lead and managed a team of 4 students.
    - Developed new admin panel, which improved internal operating efficiency by over 40%.
    - Rebuilt entire website with up to date technologies and frameworks.
